To tackle the challenge, I would write a program that reads the CSV input, parses each line to identify values and formulas, 
evaluates the formulas, and outputs the result as a new CSV file. Here's an overview of the steps I would follow:

a. We can read the CSV file line by line. or there is another way to read all at once.

b. Split each line using the comma separator.

c. Identify if each value is a number or a formula for "=" we can say that this is for formulae.

d. If it is a number store it in a dictionary with its corresponding cell name as the key.

e. If it is a formula parse the formula to identify the cells it references and their values.

f. Evaluate the formula by replacing the cell references with their values and using standard arithmetic operations.

g. Store the result in the dictionary with the corresponding cell label as the key.

h. Repeat the above steps for all lines in the CSV input.

i. Write the dictionary to a new CSV file with the same structure as the input.
