I would check for the following errors:

a. Syntax errors in the formulas (e.g. missing operator, incorrect cell reference).

b. Circular references in the formulas i.e a cell references another cell that references it back.

c. Missing cell references in the formulas.

d. Division by zero errors in the formulas.

e. We can handle the exception also with appropriate exception handler.
