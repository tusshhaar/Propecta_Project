A user could break the code in several ways:

a. Providing incorrect or non-existent cell references in the formulas.

b. Providing incorrect or non-numeric values in the cells.

c. Providing a formula that contains an unsupported operation.

d. Providing a file in a different format or structure than the expected CSV input.

To mitigate these issues, I would implement appropriate error handling and validation checks in the code.
